Seulement, le nom des objets est mal pris en compte pour les checks. Un petit exemple illustratif : remarque directement qu’ne peut pas créer de check avec .var.name puis créer une assert à partir de ça. Un autre possibilité serait de ne pas utiliser de .var.name pour les checks mais : Remarque : La fonction de check marche bien mais uniquement parce qu’l’doté de .var.name. Mais remarque alors que le message d’erreur n’est pas très clair… Pire : Dernière solution : faire des fonctions mixtes : Mais cette solution n’est pas viable à long terme car aimerait quand même pouvoir transformer en assert nos check (pour check_inf_2) et peut être que check_objet sera aussi appelé par une autre fonction et ne fournira alors à son tour aucune info sur les objets scannés.","code":"library(\"checkmate\") ## Warning: package 'checkmate' was built under R version 4.3.1 # Un check un peu random fait à la main check_inf_2 <- function(x, .var.name = checkmate::vname(x)) {     cond1 <- check_integerish(x, lower = 1, upper = 2)     return(ifelse(isTRUE(cond1), TRUE, paste(\"*\", .var.name, \":\", cond1))) }  assert_inf_2 <- makeAssertionFunction(check_inf_2)  print(check_inf_2(1, .var.name = \"Nom bizarre\")) ## [1] TRUE print(check_inf_2(3, .var.name = \"Nom bizarre\")) ## [1] \"* Nom bizarre : Element 1 is not <= 2\" assert_inf_2(1, .var.name = \"Nom bizarre\") ## Error in assert_inf_2(1, .var.name = \"Nom bizarre\"): argument 2 matches multiple formal arguments assert_inf_2(3, .var.name = \"Nom bizarre\") ## Error in assert_inf_2(3, .var.name = \"Nom bizarre\"): argument 2 matches multiple formal arguments # Un check sans .var.name (donc \"normal\") check_inf_2 <- function(x) {     return(check_integerish(x, lower = 1, upper = 2)) }  check_objet <- function(x) {     cond1 <- check_inf_2(x)     cond2 <- check_inf_2(length(x))          output <- c()     verif <- TRUE          if (!isTRUE(cond1)) {         output <- c(output, cond1)         verif <- FALSE     }          if (!isTRUE(cond2)) {         output <- c(output, cond2)         verif <- FALSE     }          output <- paste(\"*\", output, collapse = \"\\n\")          return(ifelse(verif, verif, output)) }  assert_objet <- makeAssertionFunction(check_objet) check_objet(4) ## [1] \"* Element 1 is not <= 2\" check_objet(c(1, 1, 2)) ## [1] \"* Element 1 is not <= 2\" assert_objet(4) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): Assertion on '4' failed: * Element 1 is not <= 2. assert_objet(c(1, 1, 2)) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): Assertion on 'c(1, 1, 2)' failed: * Element 1 is not <= 2. assert_objet(c(4, 1, 2)) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): Assertion on 'c(4, 1, 2)' failed: * Element 1 is not <= 2 ## * Element 1 is not <= 2. # Un check avec .var.name check_inf_2 <- function(x, .var.name = checkmate::vname(x)) {     cond1 <- check_integerish(x, lower = 1, upper = 2)     return(ifelse(isTRUE(cond1), TRUE, paste(\"*\", .var.name, \":\", cond1))) }  # Un check sns check_objet <- function(x) {     cond1 <- check_inf_2(x, .var.name = \"x\")     cond2 <- check_inf_2(length(x), .var.name = \"length(x)\")          output <- c()     verif <- TRUE          if (!isTRUE(cond1)) {         output <- c(output, cond1)         verif <- FALSE     }          if (!isTRUE(cond2)) {         output <- c(output, cond2)         verif <- FALSE     }          output <- paste(output, collapse = \"\\n\")          return(ifelse(verif, verif, output)) }  assert_objet <- makeAssertionFunction(check_objet) print(check_objet(c(1, 1, 2))) ## [1] \"* length(x) : Element 1 is not <= 2\" assert_objet(c(1, 1, 2)) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): Assertion on 'c(1, 1, 2)' failed: * length(x) : Element 1 is not <= 2. assert_objet(c(4, 1, 2)) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): Assertion on 'c(4, 1, 2)' failed: * x : Element 1 is not <= 2 ## * length(x) : Element 1 is not <= 2."}]
